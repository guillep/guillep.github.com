!About me

Coding enthusiast. Mad hatter. Software engineer and researcher. 

I am research engineer at the CRIStAL laboratory in the university of Lille, working in tight relation with the RMoD team. My main research interests are programming language development, programming tools, modular systems, and maintenance of large software systems.
I currently work on techniques to develop modular systems and languages, and new development tools.

I actively participate in the development of the open source *Pharo>http://www.pharo-project.org* programming language and environment since 2010, and I am a member of its technical board since 2018.

My main topics of interests are the runtime adaptation of applications, Virtual Machine design and development, and programming language tools. For that, I work on reflective applications and programming languages.

I obtained the 13 of april 2015 my Phd entitled "Virtualization support for application runtime specialization and extension" under the direction of StÃ©phane Ducasse (*Inria Rmod team>http://rmod.lille.inria.fr*) and the supervision of Noury Bouraqadi and Luc Fabresse(*CAR team>http://car.mines-douai.fr/* of Mines Douai).
