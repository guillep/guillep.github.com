!Research Activities


I organise my research in three different axes of work: programming language evolution; program inspection and debugging; implementation techniques for efficient programming languages. These three axes join together in the project AlaMVic, an Action Exploratoire Inria that I lead starting in 2021.

!! Programming language evolution and modularity

During my thesis I proposed a language virtualization infrastructure that gives language designers the ability to control and manipulate the behaviour of applications. I have used this infrastructure in the context of language evolution with three main case studies: the generation and *prototyping of VM language-kernels>https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01185812*, the *reduction of program memory footprints>https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01609295*, and the *__hot update__ of applications and language base libraries>https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01185819*. I now co-supervise the PhD thesis of Carolina Hernandez Phillips, who investigates how to extend this approach to a larger set of Virtual Machine-based programming languages.

I alwo work on new programming language concepts and infrastructures aimed at programming language modularity.
I worked on a formalisation of the *method extension mechanism>https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01609310* and a mechanism to cope with the loading of partial code named *Undefined Classes>https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01585305/*~(Best paper award IWST workshop).
With Pablo Tesone we explored a novel *language core infrastructure>https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01812612* that allows language extensions to be installed seamlessly on small language kernels, and new techniques to *update applications>https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01920362* while they are executed.


!! Program inspection and debugging

Since 2017 I explore the world of debugging, in particular in the context of parallel BigData applications. I have worked on  *out-of-place debugging>https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01952790*, a debugging infrastructure that transfers the state of failed executions to the developer's machine to make it practical. I am also interested in debugging support for new generation debuggers, and programming language support for it.

!! Implementation technology for efficient programming languages

I contribute to the implementation of the Open Source Pharo Virtual Machine, where I work on compiler construction and program optimisation. I implemented a large part of the new JIT compiler backend for the ARMv8 family of processors and I have explored VM extensions to *cope with the inefficiencies of input/output in concurrent programs>https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02379275*.

!! AlaMVic: A generative approach to virtual machine construction

Since February 2021, I lead an Action Exploratoire Inria that explores new methods to construct Virtual Machines.
This project aims to solve the high-cost of VM construction, joining together the three axes of research I've been carrying out until now: evolvable, inspectable and efficient Language Virtual Machine construction. We are now working on tackling VM construction using a holistic generative approach.
